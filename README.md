# sen-gallery
Media gallery plugin for naEKRANIE.pl


This responsive media gallery was created by me during my work at Senfino, for **Hatak Media** company which currently holds the rights to this code and was kind to let me publish it here, on GitHub, as Open Source. 

sen-gallery was developed for **naEKRANIE.pl** - one of the biggest portals about movies, TV series, games and comic books in Poland.

#### Please note:

Current version is unusable in its raw form as it was simply exported from base theme, without minor dependencies which unfortunatelly are needed for this to work as a standalone solution.

Hopefully I'll soon find time to add remaining required custom packages. And also make this readme actually valuable for developers, documenting the project, showing examples etc.
